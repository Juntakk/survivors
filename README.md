<h3>How It Works</h3>

<h4>1. Character Screen</h4>
<p>The character screen is displayed before the game starts. Players can view their stats, abilities, and choose a starting level. This screen sets up the player’s starting position and allows for customizations.</p>

<h4>2. Level Selection</h4>
<p>Players can choose a level to start the game, with each level offering a unique challenge and varying enemies. The difficulty increases as the player progresses through each wave of enemies.</p>

<h4>3. Enemy Spawning</h4>
<p>Enemies spawn in waves, and the difficulty of the waves increases over time. As the player levels up, stronger enemies begin to appear, adding to the challenge.</p>

<h4>4. Leveling Up</h4>
<p>As players defeat enemies, they gain experience points and level up. Upon leveling up, players can choose new abilities or items that help them survive longer against the increasing difficulty.</p>

<h4>5. Item Drops</h4>
<p>Enemies drop items when defeated. These items provide various boosts such as health regeneration, damage increases, or special abilities that help the player during the game.</p>

<h4>6. Game Over Screen</h4>
<p>If the player’s character is defeated by enemies, the game over screen appears. Players are given the option to restart or quit the game. The game tracks progress and rewards players for surviving longer.</p>
